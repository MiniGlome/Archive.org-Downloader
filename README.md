    Python3 script to download archive.org books in PDF format
    <br />
    </p>
</p>

## About The Project

There are many great books available on https://openlibrary.org/ and https://archive.org/, however, you can only borrow them for 1 hour to 14 days and you don't have the option to download it as a PDF to read it offline or share it with your friends. I created this program to solve this problem and retrieve the original book in pdf format for FREE!

Of course, the download takes a few minutes depending on the number of pages and the quality of the images you have selected. You must also create an account on https://archive.org/ for the script to work.

## Getting Started

To get started you need to have python3 installed. If it is not the case you can download it here : https://www.python.org/downloads/

### Installation

Make sure you've already git installed. Then you can run the following commands to get the scripts on your computer:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MiniGlome/Archive.org-Downloader.git
cd Archive.org-Downloader
```

The script requires the modules `requests`, `tqdm` and `img2pdf`, you can install them all at once with this command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```sh
usage: archive-org-downloader.py [-h] -e EMAIL -p PASSWORD [-u URL] [-d DIR] [-f FILE] [-r RESOLUTION] [-t THREADS] [-j]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -e EMAIL, --email EMAIL
                        Your archive.org email
  -p PASSWORD, --password PASSWORD
                        Your archive.org password
  -u URL, --url URL     Link to the book (https://archive.org/details/XXXX). You can use this argument several times
                        to download multiple books
  -d DIR, --dir DIR     Output directory
  -f FILE, --file FILE  File where are stored the URLs of the books to download
  -r RESOLUTION, --resolution RESOLUTION
                        Image resolution (10 to 0, 0 is the highest), [default 3]
  -t THREADS, --threads THREADS
                        Maximum number of threads, [default 50]
  -j, --jpg             Output to individual JPG's rather than a PDF
  -m, --meta            Output the metadata of the book to a json file
```

The `email` and `password` fields are required, so to use this script you must have a registered account on archive.org.
The `-r` argument specifies the resolution of the images (0 is the best quality).
The PDF are downloaded in the current folder

### Example

This command will download the 3 books as pdf in the best possible quality. To only download the individual images you can use `--jpg`.

```sh
python3 archive-org-downloader.py -e myemail@tempmail.com -p Passw0rd -r 0 -u https://archive.org/details/IntermediatePython -u https://archive.org/details/horrorgamispooky0000bidd_m7r1 -u https://archive.org/details/elblabladelosge00gaut
```

If you want to download a lot of books, you can paste the urls of the books in a .txt file (one per line) and use `--file`

```sh
python3 archive-org-downloader.py -e myemail@tempmail.com -p Passw0rd --file books_to_download.txt
```

### ðŸ”§ Configuration File (`~/.archive-org.ini`)

Instead of passing credentials and defaults every time, you can create a config file at:

```
~/.archive-org.ini
```

#### ðŸ“„ Example

```ini
[credentials]
email = your_email@example.com
password = your_password

[defaults]
# Image resolution from 10 (lowest) to 0 (highest). Matches --resolution
resolution = 3

# Maximum number of threads to use when downloading pages. Matches --threads
threads = 50

# Directory to save the final PDF(s). Must exist and be writable. Matches --dir
dir = /Volumes/Books/Downloads
```

#### ðŸ§  Notes

- Any value passed on the command line **overrides** the value in the config.
- If `dir` is specified but the folder doesnâ€™t exist (e.g., an unmounted external drive), the script will stop with a warning.
- Downloaded page images are stored in a **temporary folder** and deleted automatically after the PDF is created.
- Make sure this file is only readable by you:
  ```sh
  chmod 600 ~/.archive-org.ini
  ```
