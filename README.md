    Python3 script to download archive.org books in PDF format !
    <br />
    </p>
</p>


## About The Project

There are many great books available on https://openlibrary.org/ and https://archive.org/, however, you can only borrow them for 1 hour to 14 days and you don't have the option to download it as a PDF to read it offline or share it with your friends. I created this program to solve this problem and retrieve the original book in pdf format for FREE !

Of course, the download takes a few minutes depending on the number of pages and the quality of the images you have selected. You must also create an account on https://archive.org/ for the script to work.


## Getting Started
To get started you need to have python3 installed. If it is not the case you can download it here : https://www.python.org/downloads/

### Installation
Make sure you've already git installed. Then you can run the following commands to get the scripts on your computer:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/MiniGlome/Archive.org-Downloader.git
   cd Archive.org-Downloader
   ```
The script requires the modules `requests`, `tqdm` and `img2pdf`, you can install them all at once with this command:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
   
## Usage
```
usage: archive-org-downloader.py [-h] -e EMAIL -p PASSWORD [-d DIR] [-r RESOLUTION] [-t THREADS] [-j] URL [URL ...]

positional arguments:
  URL                   Link to the book (https://archive.org/details/XXXX).
                        You can use this argument several times to download multiple books

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -e EMAIL, --email EMAIL
                        Your archive.org email
  -p PASSWORD, --password PASSWORD
                        Your archive.org password
  -d DIR, --dir DIR     Output directory
  -r RESOLUTION, --resolution RESOLUTION
                        Image resolution (10 to 0, 0 is the highest), [default 3]
  -t THREADS, --threads THREADS
                        Maximum number of threads, [default 50]
  -j, --jpg             Output to individual JPG's rather than a PDF

You can use @myfile to read arguments from the file myfile, one per line.
```
The `email` and `password` fields are required, so to use this script you must have a registered account on archive.org.
The `-r` argument specifies the resolution of the images (0 is the best quality).
The PDF are downloaded in the current folder

### Example
This command will download the 3 books as pdf in the best possible quality. To only downlaod the individual images you can use `--jpg`.
```sh
python3 archive-org-downloader.py -e myemail@tempmail.com -p Passw0rd -r 0 https://archive.org/details/IntermediatePython https://archive.org/details/horrorgamispooky0000bidd_m7r1 https://archive.org/details/elblabladelosge00gaut
```

If you want to download a lot of books in a raw you can paste the urls of the books in a .txt file (one per line) and use `@file`
```sh
python3 archive-org-downloader.py -e myemail@tempmail.com -p Passw0rd @books_to_download.txt
```

You can also put your credentials (and any other arguments) in an `@file`:
```
-e
myemail@tempmail.com
-p
Passw0rd
```

Note: the previously required `-u` `--url` `-f` `--file` options have been removed.
Now just put the URLs without `-u`, and use `@myfile` instead of `-f myfile`.
